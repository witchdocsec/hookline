Only use for educational purposes or with consent! Hookline the UltraPhisher is a powerful SE tool that emulates the target's homepage by impersonating google search and using tabunder. When possible (most of the time) hookline will clone a page live as the target clicks a link and inject malicious code from 1 of several options.
